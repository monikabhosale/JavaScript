What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a cross-platform programming language for front-end and back-end development.
JavaScript is used in building web pages, backend servers, and interactive applications with interactive user experience.
It is created to make the static pages more dynamic with sophisticated features and functionality like search boxes on websites like Amazon, 
interactive maps, refreshing content updates on social media platforms, etc.

JavaScript was developed in the year 1994 for only the Netscape browser to bring interaction on the webpages. 
It was in 1997 when the first standardized version of JavaScript was introduced by ECMAScript.
From then till today, newer versions of Javascript have been developed like ECMAScript 12 to primarily standardize the language,
and provide better execution, interaction, and performance of the language.
JavaScript became the fundamental scripting language for front-end development with HTML and CSS.
Let us read about an example to get a clear idea of what functionality JavaScript bring to web pages or applications

JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that allows you to add interactive elements to web pages. For example, 
allowing users to log in after clicking the login button is possible through JavaScript only.
Earlier JavaScript was limited to only front-end development but with the introduction of virtual engines like Google V8 and Node.
js, it can also function well for server-side development as well.
For example, the set of JavaScript objects and elements like Array, Date, operators, control structures, etc 
provide the functionality to run JavaScript on the server as well as on the browser.
It helps in performing functions like accessing low-level I/O API, communicating with a database and so much more

What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a programming language that is syntactical to JavaScript.
It means it includes all the features of JavaScript and additional features as well.
You must be wondering then, what is the difference or why we need TypeScript? JavaScript is one of the fundamental scripting front-end languages for web development.
However,there were some quirks or problems, for which Microsoft created TypeScript in 2012.
It is in the features and characteristics of the language, that lies the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript. 
So, let us read about the key features of JavaScript and TypeScript.
